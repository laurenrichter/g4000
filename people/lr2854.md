Hi, my name is Lauren and I'm a ~~perpetual student~~ pediatric endocrinologist who wasn't overwhelmed enough doing just school or just work, so I decided to try both at the same time. I'm excited to learn how to use biomedical informatics as a way to improve healthcare delivery for all by creating useful tools to optimize clinical work flow and predict patients outcomes.
